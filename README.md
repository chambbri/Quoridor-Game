# Quoridor-Game
Python program that simulates the Quoridor board game

Rules of the game:
The object of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may 
either move your pawn or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not 
completely block them off. Meanwhile, they are trying to do the same to you. The first pawn to reach 
the opposite side wins.
